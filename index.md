I occassionaly update this page with my projects/papers/hobbies.

Most of my code is in [**bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/footbar). However, I do follow the projects of my interest in [**github**](https://github.com/footbar). Not all of my code is public.

I enjoy travelling and photography. I follow a lot of football (soccer for some).

Currently I live in Finland working on a cloud based software solution for a telecom product.
